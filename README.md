# TIxy
Ticketing system using python using os concepts 
TIxy is a Python-based movie ticket booking system that efficiently handles multiple user requests using operating system (OS) concepts such as multiprocessing, inter-process communication (IPC), process synchronization, and file handling. The system allows users to select a movie, specify the number of tickets, and process bookings in a concurrent environment while ensuring data consistency and preventing race conditions.
